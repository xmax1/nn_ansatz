- change opt to nan safe
- fix new crash obs

-  if nan again, yper

- run all rs and plot gr 
- include the std?? 
- read markus email

- Richard Needs - electron / phonon coupling  ~20yrs
    - 


# 12/09/22

- Why are the distances not sqrt(3*scale**2)? 
    - Not loading the pbc sampler
    - pbc sampling is broken?
        - test this quickly

- plot the envelope
    - what is the scale? 1e-2 - 1 - lots of points
    - when calculate 
    - always use opposite spins

- how to factor in the density parameter to the units? 
    - we are in electron gas units
        - cusp is r_s / 4
        - mean distance 
        - write down the units math 

- g(r) pair correlation function
    - we expect to go to density at large distance (divide by denisty 3/4\pi, in the units we use the density this as L=1)
    - the counts should be divided by 4 \pi r^2 dr * density (number of particles expected if uniform)
    - density not r_s
    - go through math, check the normalisation!

- retake the activation sweep data

# 05/09/22

- Write script to summarise over seeds *
- Write script to summarise over experiments via seeds *
- Write script to read in the sweep config keys then print the items of interest (jupyter) *
- Add basic activation analysis to done list * 
- Analyse the jastrow models against the kato cusp conditions ~ 
- Saverio notes and equations 

- Cusp finish
    - Plot of psi against distance
    - Do we get the same number for all electrons
    - what is the derivative of a log
- other calcs do
